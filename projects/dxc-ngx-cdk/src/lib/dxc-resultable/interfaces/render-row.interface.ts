/**
 * Set of properties that represents the identity of a single rendered row.
 *
 * When the table needs to determine the list of rows to render, it will do so by iterating through
 * each data object and evaluating its list of row templates to display (when multiTemplateDataRows
 * is false, there is only one template per data object). For each pair of data object and row
 * template, a `RenderRow` is added to the list of rows to render. If the data object and row
 * template pair has already been rendered, the previously used `RenderRow` is added; else a new
 * `RenderRow` is * created. Once the list is complete and all data objects have been itereated
 * through, a diff is performed to determine the changes that need to be made to the rendered rows.
